# EUReKA Science Program: Tech Camp Week 3

Hello EUReKA Campers! 

One of the main reasons that we used GitHub this year for camp was to give an easy way for you all to access your files at home! 

Once you've gotten to this point, ensure that you are on the master branch and then look for the button that says "Clone or download" on the right side. Click that and then press "Download ZIP".

At this point your computer is now downloading a compressed version of this repository! You'll want to save it a convenient location, and then "unzip" it using whatever software you have on your computer to do this. I know Windows 10 has this functionality built in, but I am unfamiliar with MacOS. Once it is uncompressed to a location on your computer, you have full access to all the files you made at Summer Camp! Just navigate to the name of your super hero and you're good! 

If you have any questions about the types of projects we made this summer, or how you can continue working on them, feel free to read the this PDF (PDF still under construction! Check back in a bit) which contains all sorts of information and resources for you!


Aside from that, if you have any questions not answered by that PDF, feel free to reach out to me by email at "reed.mcilwain@hotmail.com"!

Good luck in the future wherever your journeys take you!
